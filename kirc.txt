NAME
       kirc - a tiny, dependency-light IRC client

SYNOPSIS
       kirc [-s server] [-p port] [-c channel(s)] [-r realname] [-u username] [-k password] [-a auth] <nickname>

DESCRIPTION
       kirc  is  an extremely fast and simple Internet Relay Chat (IRC) client designed with portability and minimalism in mind, following the "Keep
       It Simple, Stupid" (KISS) philosophy. It provides a keyboard-driven interface for real-time IRC communication and is optimized to run on sys-
       tems with minimal dependencies, making it suitable for embedded systems, lightweight containers, and resource-constrained environments.

       The primary design principle of kirc is to maintain a small codebase while providing essential IRC functionality. The client follows the Unix
       philosophy of doing one thing well: it reads from STDIN and prints to STDOUT, allowing all traffic to be  easily  multiplexed  and  processed
       through external commands and shell pipelines. This design enables powerful text filtering, logging, and integration with other Unix tools.

       All  highlighted  text and color can be controlled with ANSI escape sequences, providing full control over output styling and appearance. The
       client is compatible with both traditional and modern terminal emulators.

       For best results and optimal rendering with full color support, use a terminal emulator with 256 color support, such as xterm-256color, GNOME
       Terminal, Konsole, or iTerm2. Most modern terminal emulators will provide a pleasant experience with kirc with default settings.

OPTIONS
       The following options are available. These can also be set using environment variables (see ENVIRONMENT section), which will be overridden by
       any command-line arguments. The nickname argument is always required.

       -s server
              Specifies the IRC server hostname or IP address to connect to. The server name is passed directly to the network layer without valida-
              tion, so ensure it is correct before connecting.
              Default: irc.libera.chat

       -p port
              Specifies the TCP port number used to connect to the IRC server. Standard IRC ports are 6667 (plaintext) and 6697 (with TLS/SSL).  En-
              sure your firewall permits outbound connections on the specified port.
              Default: 6667

       -c channel(s)
              Specifies the channel(s) to JOIN upon successful connection. Multiple channels can be specified as a comma-separated or pipe-separated
              list  without  spaces (e.g., "#channel1,#channel2"). The first channel in the list will be set as the default target for messages sent
              without an explicit destination. Channel names must conform to IRC specifications (typically starting with # or &).

       -r realname
              Specifies the user's real name as sent during the IRC connection handshake. This value is visible in WHOIS queries and other user  in-
              formation  lookups performed by other users. If not specified, the client defaults to using the nickname. This can be any string up to
              63 characters.

       -u username
              Specifies the USER connection username, which becomes part of your user's hostmask (e.g., user@host). This is displayed in various IRC
              commands and messages. If not specified, the client defaults to using the nickname. This should typically be  alphanumeric  characters
              without spaces.

       -k password
              Specifies the plain text PASS connection value, typically used for authentication with the server or services. This is sent during the
              initial connection phase.  Be cautious with this option as the password is visible in the command history and process list. For sensi-
              tive configurations, consider using the KIRC_PASSWORD environment variable instead.

       -a auth
              Specifies SASL (Simple Authentication and Security Layer) authentication mechanism and token value to be used for connection authenti-
              cation.  The  argument  value  is  comprised of a colon-delimited string, where the first token is the authentication mechanism (e.g.,
              "PLAIN", "EXTERNAL", "SCRAM-SHA-256", etc.) and the second string  is  the  mechanism-specific  authentication  credential  (typically
              BASE64  encoded).   For  the  PLAIN  mechanism, you can provide either a pre-encoded BASE64 token or three colon-separated values (au-
              thzid:authcid:passwd) which will be automatically encoded.
              Example: "PLAIN:amlsbGVzAGppbGxlcwBzZXNhbWU=" or "PLAIN:alice:alice:password"

EXIT STATUS
       0      Successful program execution and normal client termination.

       1      Usage error, syntax error, connection failure, or other operational error. Check the terminal output for specific  error  messages  to
              diagnose the issue.

ENVIRONMENT
       The  following  environment  variables can be used to set defaults for connection parameters. All environment variables will be overridden by
       any corresponding command-line options. This is useful for creating shell aliases or scripts that establish connections with specific parame-
       ters.

       KIRC_SERVER
              Default IRC server hostname or IP address. Equivalent to the -s option.

       KIRC_PORT
              Default server port number. Equivalent to the -p option.

       KIRC_CHANNELS
              Default channels to join upon connection (comma or pipe separated). Equivalent to the -c option.

       KIRC_REALNAME
              Default real name to use in WHOIS and other user information. Equivalent to the -r option.

       KIRC_USERNAME
              Default username for the connection. Equivalent to the -u option.

       KIRC_PASSWORD
              Default password for connection authentication. Equivalent to the -k option. Be cautious storing sensitive information in  environment
              variables.

       KIRC_AUTH
              Default SASL authentication token and mechanism. Equivalent to the -a option.

COMMANDS
       Once connected to an IRC server, kirc supports the following commands. Commands are entered in the input line and executed by pressing ENTER.
       Text entered without a command prefix is treated as a message to the current target.

       /<command>
              Send  a  raw IRC command to the server. This allows direct access to all IRC protocol commands. Examples include /JOIN, /PART, /WHOIS,
              /NICK, /KICK, /BAN, /TOPIC, /MODE, /INVITE, and many others. Refer to IRC protocol documentation (RFC 1459) for  a  complete  list  of
              supported commands. The client does not validate or pre-process raw commands, so ensure correct syntax before sending.

       /set <target>
              Set  the  default message channel or nickname to <target>.  All subsequent messages entered without an explicit target will be sent to
              this channel or user. The current target is typically displayed in the status line or prompt area.

       /topic <channel> [<topic>]
              Query or set the topic for the specified <channel>.  When invoked with only a channel name, the command requests and displays the cur-
              rent channel topic. When a <topic> string is provided, it sets the channel topic to the specified text (subject to  channel  mode  re-
              strictions and operator privileges).

       <message>
              Send  a  PRIVMSG  to  the currently set target (channel or nickname) with <message> as the message content. This is the primary way to
              communicate in IRC. Messages are displayed to all users in the target channel or privately to the target user.

       @<target> <message>
              Send a PRIVMSG to a specified <target> (channel or nickname) with <message> as the content, without changing the default target.  This
              allows sending one-off messages to other destinations while maintaining your primary conversation context.

       /me <action>
              Send  a  CTCP  ACTION command to the currently set target. This displays your message as an action (e.g., "* alice does something") to
              all users in the target channel or to the target user. Commonly used for expressing actions or emotions.

       /ctcp <target> <command> [<arguments>...]
              Send a raw Client-to-Client Protocol (CTCP) command to the specified <target> nickname or channel. Common CTCP commands include  "CLI-
              ENTINFO", "TIME", "VERSION", "PING", and "DCC". Arguments are separated by spaces. CTCP commands are typically used for client discov-
              ery and file transfers (see DCC FILE TRANSFERS section).

KEY BINDINGS
       kirc  provides  standard readline-style key bindings for line editing and command history navigation. The following key combinations are sup-
       ported:

       CTRL+C Force quit kirc immediately, disconnecting from the server without sending a QUIT command. This is useful for emergency termination or
              when the normal exit mechanism is unresponsive.

       CTRL+U Delete the entire current input line, clearing all typed text and returning to an empty prompt.

       Arrow Left (or CTRL+B)
              Move cursor one character to the left.

       Arrow Right (or CTRL+F)
              Move cursor one character to the right.

       Arrow Up (or CTRL+P)
              Navigate backwards through command history, displaying the previous command entered.  Pressing multiple  times  cycles  through  older
              commands.

       Arrow Down (or CTRL+N)
              Navigate  forwards  through command history, displaying the next (more recent) command entered. Pressing at the end of history returns
              to the empty prompt.

       Home (or CTRL+A)
              Move cursor to the beginning of the current input line.

       End (or CTRL+E)
              Move cursor to the end of the current input line.

       Delete Delete the character at the current cursor position.

       Backspace (or CTRL+H)
              Delete the character immediately before the cursor position and move the cursor back one character.

EXAMPLES
   Basic usage
       kirc alice
              Connect with nickname 'alice' to the default Libera.Chat server (irc.libera.chat:6667).  The client will use 'alice' as  the  username
              and real name if not otherwise specified.

   Advanced connection parameters
       kirc -s irc.example.org -p 6667 -c #foo,#bar alice
              Connect  to  a custom IRC server (irc.example.org) on port 6667 and automatically join the channels #foo and #bar upon connection. The
              #foo channel becomes the default message target.

   Environment variables
       KIRC_SERVER=irc.libera.chat KIRC_PORT=6697 kirc alice
              Use environment variables to set the server and port for this session. These values can be permanently set in shell profile files  for
              convenience.

   Logging
       kirc alice | tee -a kirc-$(date +%Y%m%d).log
              Connect and simultaneously save all output to a log file named with the current date (e.g., kirc-20251229.log). The tee command dupli-
              cates output while the -a flag appends to the file rather than overwriting it.

   SASL authentication
       kirc -a PLAIN:alice:alice:password alice
              Connect using SASL PLAIN authentication with automatic token encoding. The client will automatically encode the authzid:authcid:passwd
              values into the proper BASE64 format required by the SASL PLAIN mechanism.

       kirc -a "PLAIN:$(printf '%s %s %s' 'alice' 'alice' 'password' | base64)" alice
              Alternatively,  generate  a  BASE64-encoded  SASL PLAIN authentication token manually and connect using SASL authentication. The token
              format is "username username password" (with NULL bytes represented as \0) encoded in BASE64. This demonstrates manual  token  genera-
              tion for the SASL PLAIN mechanism.

   TLS/SSL connections via socat
       socat tcp-listen:6667,reuseaddr,fork,bind=127.0.0.1 ssl:irc.example.org:6697 & kirc -s 127.0.0.1 alice
              Establish  a TLS/SSL encrypted connection to irc.example.org by proxying through socat.  Socat listens on local port 6667 and forwards
              all traffic through an encrypted channel to the remote server's port 6697. This approach is useful when kirc doesn't have  native  TLS
              support or when additional connection filtering is needed.

   Proxy connections via socat
       socat tcp-listen:6667,fork,reuseaddr,bind=127.0.0.1 proxy:<proxyurl>:irc.example.org:6667,proxyport=<proxyport> & kirc -s 127.0.0.1 -p 6667
       alice
              Connect  to irc.example.org through an HTTP/HTTPS proxy server using socat as an intermediary. Replace <proxyurl> and <proxyport> with
              your actual proxy server details. This technique allows IRC access from networks with strict outbound connection policies.

DCC FILE TRANSFERS
   Overview
       kirc supports Direct Client-to-Client (DCC) file transfers, including XDCC file requests commonly used on IRC file servers. DCC transfers oc-
       cur directly between IRC clients without passing through the IRC server, making them independent of server bandwidth limitations.

   Receiving files
       When another IRC user sends you a file via DCC SEND, kirc automatically detects the incoming file transfer request and begins downloading the
       file to the current working directory. The client will display a status message:

              dcc: receiving <filename> from <sender> (<size> bytes)

       Transfer progress and completion messages will appear as the file downloads.  The file is saved with its original filename. If  a  file  with
       the  same name exists, the behavior depends on the client configuration. Files are saved relative to the current working directory from which
       kirc was launched.

   XDCC requests
       To request a file from an XDCC bot, use the standard XDCC request format:

              /ctcp <botname> XDCC SEND #<packet_number>

       The bot will initiate a DCC SEND transfer.  kirc automatically handles the incoming transfer and begins downloading the requested file.  Mul-
       tiple XDCC requests can be queued with a single bot, and the bot will process them sequentially.

   Limitations
       kirc supports up to 16 simultaneous DCC transfers. Exceeding this limit will reject additional transfer requests. Files are always  saved  to
       the current working directory with their original filenames. Ensure adequate disk space is available before initiating large file transfers.

STANDARDS
       kirc  implements  the  Internet  Relay Chat protocol as defined in RFC 1459, RFC 2222 (SASL), and IRCv3.1 specifications. The client supports
       CTCP (Client-to-Client Protocol) extensions for client-to-client communication and file transfers.
